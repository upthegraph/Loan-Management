# Loan Appliaction
Color Scheme: https://colorhunt.co/palette/281694

# Some Info
CreateLoan Page is a private route i.e its synonymous to Auction page, so is applied.js. Basically, when user logs in or signs up, he is routed to the createloan page where he fills his required form and when he submits, applied.js page is shown.

StartScreen.js basically has the login button shown in home pages

Assets folder just has the svg, which I modified and imported as a react component in app.js to keep it in tact in every page.

I know that it looks like I've done very little but I tried to do my best especially following ur type of writing. Imitating and understanding someone else's code is difficult. Most of the time I spent at night was on trying to understand the Ipl auction's code to imitate similar behaviour here. Rest assured I have done half of the UI, set color themes and all. Lil more tweaks will do. Didn't sleep whole night, will try to sleep now :)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
